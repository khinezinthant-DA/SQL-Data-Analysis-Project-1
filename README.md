This project showcases my SQL skills by analyzing a Spotify dataset from Kaggle using PostgreSQL in pgAdmin 4. The focus is on data cleaning, exploration, and query practice to extract meaningful insights from music data. You can see my SQL code file <a href="https://github.com/khinezinthant-DA/SQL-Data-Analysis-Project-1/blob/main/SQL%20file.sql"> here </a>. 

## Tools & Technologies
- PostgreSQL (pgAdmin 4)
- SQL Queries (SELECT, Aggregations, Window Functions, CTEs)
- <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sanjanchaudhari/spotify-dataset">Spotify Dataset</a> from Kaggle 
- Reference Video Tutorial: - <a href="https://youtu.be/nHjIsKZ79-M?si=l50dc6ESfTK7rV2R">Zero Analyst</a>

## Project Workflow
1. Built SQL table and imported the Spotify dataset
2. Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand trends
3. Practiced 15 SQL queries across three difficulty levels:
   - Easy 
   - Medium 
   - Advanced 
4. Queries were written independently first and then cross-checked with reference solutions
   
## Easy Level Queries
1. Retrieve track names with more than 1 billion streams
2. List all albums along with their respective artists
3. Get the total number of comments for tracks where licensed = TRUE
4. Find all tracks that belong to the album type single
5. Count the total number of tracks by each artist

## Medium Level Queries
6. Calculate the average danceability of tracks in each album
7. Find the top 5 tracks with the highest energy values
8. List tracks along with views and likes where official_video = TRUE
9. For each album, calculate the total views of all tracks
10. Retrieve track names that have been streamed on Spotify more than YouTube

## Advanced Level Queries

11. Find the top 3 most-viewed tracks for each artist using window functions
12. Find tracks where the liveness score is above the average
13. Use a WITH clause to calculate the difference between highest and lowest energy in each album
14. Find tracks where the energy-to-liveness ratio is greater than 1.2
15. Calculate the cumulative sum of likes for tracks ordered by views using window functions

## Key Skills Demonstrated
- SQL table creation and data import
- Writing complex SELECT queries with GROUP BY, HAVING
- Using subqueries, CTEs, and window functions
- Performing EDA on a real-world dataset
- Extracting actionable insights from raw music data

## What I learned
Through this project, I strengthened my SQL and data analysis skills by creating tables, importing real-world data, writing queries of varying complexity, using aggregations, CTEs, and window functions, and performing exploratory data analysis to uncover patterns in music trends. I also practiced translating raw data into actionable insights, improving both my problem-solving and analytical thinking.
